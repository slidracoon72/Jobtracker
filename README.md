# Project Name: JobTracker

## Project Overview
The JobTracker project aims to develop a browser extension that streamlines the job application process. This extension will empower users to efficiently track and manage their job applications, providing a comprehensive tool for job seekers. It will offer a range of features to enhance the job application experience.

## Target Audience
This project is designed to benefit job seekers and professionals actively searching for employment opportunities. JobTracker will assist users in organizing their job application activities, keeping track of their progress, and staying informed about application statuses. It is particularly valuable for individuals who apply to multiple jobs and want to maintain a detailed record of their applications.

## Database Information
The database associated with the JobTracker extension will store essential data related to job applications:
- Job title
- Company
- Date and time of clicking on a job listing
- Application status (e.g., in progress, under review, applied, rejected, etc.)
- User-added notes or comments

## Easiest Part of the Project
The easiest part of this project is expected to be the development of the extension's user interface and frontend. This phase involves creating a user-friendly interface for tracking clicked job listings, marking jobs as "Applied," and providing easy access to the user's job application history.

## Most Difficult Part of the Project
The most challenging aspect of this project is likely to be the integration with LinkedIn and other job boards to provide real-time updates on job application statuses made through job boards. This task involves complex technical work, including interaction with external APIs, handling authentication, and ensuring data accuracy. Additionally, ensuring cross-browser compatibility across various web browsers may also pose significant challenges.
